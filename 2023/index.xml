Abstract Systems engineering increasingly relies on modeling as the complexity of systems increases. Thales, for example, released in open source the Capella environment dedicated to Model-Based Systems Engineering. Plenty of modeling environments such as that one are built upon elaborate open-source technologies that rely on one core technology, EMF (Eclipse Modeling Framework) which became a de facto standard many years ago.</description></item></channel></rss>
