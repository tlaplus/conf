### Alloy for TLA+ Users

#### Jay Parlar
##### Okta

Alloy (http://alloytools.org/) is a modelling language for software systems, out of MIT. Like TLA+, it comes bundled with an IDE and a model checker. Its mathematical foundation is also based on sets and predicate logic. Where Alloy differs from TLA+ is in its "visualizer", its use of SAT solvers, and its focus on modelling relational data instead of concurrent systems. This talk provides a high level overview of Alloy for a typical TLA+ user, and show instances where one might choose Alloy over TLA+, and vice-versa, and more importantly, why it's hugely valuable to know both systems.

One-page Summary of Content:

* Introduction

  * Show the visualizer theme editor
* Show invariant checks
* Show multiple "run" statements
* Describe relational data underpinnings of Alloy
  * Everything is sets and relations
  * Show the JOIN operator
  * Show transitive closure operator
* Describe building out a model from scratch
  * Illustrate how the visualizer often points out areas a human might not think of
  * Like TLA+, Alloy is a tool to help you think better
