The program consists of a mix of tutorials on the TLA+ specification language and its supporting tools. The tutorials do not assume previous knowledge of TLA+ or the tools. Participants are strongly encouraged to install the TLA Toolbox and the TLA+ Proof System on their laptops.

Participants must register through the Strange Loop registration page.
