09:00 (tentative) | Keynote: *Fifteen years of formal methods at AWS* - Just under a decade ago, we published [“How Amazon Web Services Uses Formal Methods”](https://www.amazon.science/publications/how-amazon-web-services-uses-formal-methods) in CACM, describing our experiences with formal methods (especially TLA+) building production systems at AWS. In this talk, I’ll look back over the decade since that paper, how our practice has evolved since then, and the challenges for the future. | [Marc Brooker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marc-brooker-b431772b/) |  |  |
