### What is TLA+?
<!-- Point at industrial success stories of TLA+ (Amazon/Microsoft/...) -->
TLA<sup>+</sup> is a formal language for specifying systems used in industry and academia to verify complex distributed and concurrent systems. Among others, the TLA<sup>+</sup> methodology is successfully applied at [Amazon Web Services](http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/amazon-excerpt.html) and [Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-cosmos-db-pushing-the-frontier-of-globally-distributed-databases/).

### TLA+ Conference?

TLA<sup>+</sup> conference brings together industrial and academic users of the TLA<sup>+</sup> specification language and its associated tools; it complements the biannual [TLA<sup>+</sup> workshops](http://tla2018.loria.fr/) with a stronger focus on applying TLA<sup>+</sup>. Talks should present work of interest to users of TLA<sup>+</sup> or PlusCal, such as but not limited to:

* Industrial and academic case studies
* Use of the TLA<sup>+</sup> tools or reports on their shortcomings
* Novel tools & techniques exploiting TLA<sup>+</sup> and its existing tools
* Teaching TLA<sup>+</sup> and its combination with other (software) engineering methodologies
