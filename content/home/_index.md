### What is TLA+?
<!-- Point at industrial success stories of TLA+ (Amazon/Microsoft/...) -->
TLA<sup>+</sup> is a formal language for specifying systems that is used in industry and academia to verify complex distributed and concurrent systems. Among others, the TLA<sup>+</sup> methodology is successfully applied at [Amazon Web Services](http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/amazon.html) and [Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-cosmos-db-pushing-the-frontier-of-globally-distributed-databases/).

Tool support for TLA<sup>+</sup> is provided through the TLA<sup>+</sup> Toolbox, an Integrated Development Environment for writing TLA<sup>+</sup> specifications and analyzing them using the TLA<sup>+</sup> tools. The tools include the TLC model checker, the PlusCal algorithm language and its translator, and the TLA<sup>+</sup> Proof System.

### TLA+ Conference?

The objective of the TLA<sup>+</sup> Conference is to bring together industrial users of the TLA<sup>+</sup> specification language and its associated tools and complements the well established [TLA+ workshops](http://tla2018.loria.fr/). The conference will consist of invited talks that present developments concerning the TLA<sup>+</sup> language and tools, and of contributed talks.

Contributed talks should present work of interest to users of TLA<sup>+</sup> or PlusCal, such as but not limited to:

* Industrial and academic case studies
* Use of the TLA<sup>+</sup> tools or reports on their shortcomings
* Teaching of TLA<sup>+</sup> in industry or universities

The presentations should be informal and leave sufficient time for discussions. There will not be formal proceedings, and presentations of relevant work published elsewhere are welcome.

#### When?

Proposals for presentations, with a short (1-2 page) abstract summarizing the content, should be sent by July 01, 2019 to \<\<tla2019>> \o \<\<@>> \o \<\<tlapl.us>>. Notification will be given by July 15, 2019. The abstracts and presentations given at the event will be made available on the web.

#### Where?

The conference will take place in St. Louis, MO, USA, on September 15, 2019 as part of Strange Loop 2019. Participants are required to register through the [Strange Loop web site](https://thestrangeloop.com/register.html).
