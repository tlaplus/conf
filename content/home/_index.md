### What is TLA+?
<!-- Point at industrial success stories of TLA+ (Amazon/Microsoft/...) -->
TLA<sup>+</sup> is a formal language for specifying systems used in industry and academia to verify complex distributed and concurrent systems. Among others, the TLA<sup>+</sup> methodology is successfully applied at [Amazon Web Services](http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/amazon-excerpt.html) and [Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-cosmos-db-pushing-the-frontier-of-globally-distributed-databases/).

### TLA+ Conference?

The TLA<sup>+</sup> Community Event 2023 will be organized as a satellite of ETAPS 2023 (https://etaps.org) in Paris, on April 22, 2023. It brings together the community of users of the TLA<sup>+</sup> specification language and its associated tools.
