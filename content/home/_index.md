### What is TLA+?
<!-- Point at industrial success stories of TLA+ (Amazon/Microsoft/...) -->
TLA<sup>+</sup> is a formal language for specifying systems that is used in industry and academia to verify complex distributed and concurrent systems. Among others, the TLA<sup>+</sup> methodology is successfully applied at [Amazon Web Services](http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/amazon-excerpt.html) and [Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-cosmos-db-pushing-the-frontier-of-globally-distributed-databases/).

### TLA+ Community Event?

The objective of the TLA+ Community Events is to bring together practitioners and researchers interested in the use and further development of the TLA+ specification language and its associated tools.  Talks should present work of interest to users of TLA+ or PlusCal, such as:

* industrial and academic case studies
* new tools for TLA+
* innovative use of existing tools or reports on their shortcomings
* use of TLA+ in education

There will be no formal proceedings, and presentations of relevant work published elsewhere are welcome. Presentations - of either 20 or 30 minutes - must be recorded and submitted before the event for early distribution. After the official airing of a presentation during the event, a (synchronous) Q&A session will discuss the presentation.

Proposals for 20 or 30 minutes presentations, with a short (1-2 page) abstract summarizing the content, should be sent by August 31, 2020, to tla2020 @ tlapl.us. Notification will be posted soon after.

The workshop is planned as a satellite of the [Symposium on Distributed Computing](http://www.disc-conference.org/wp/disc2020/) and will take place on-line in mid-October 2020 (exact date and format to be announced).
