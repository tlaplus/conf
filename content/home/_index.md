### What is TLA+?

TLA<sup>+</sup> is a formal language for specifying systems that is used in academia and industry. Tool support for TLA+ is provided through the TLA<sup>+</sup> Toolbox, an Integrated Development Environment for writing TLA<sup>+</sup> specifications and analyzing them using the TLA<sup>+</sup> tools. The tools include the TLC model checker, the PlusCal algorithm language and translator, and the TLA<sup>+</sup> Proof System.

### TLA+ Conference?

The objective of the TLA<sup>+</sup> Conference is to bring together industrial users of the TLA<sup>+</sup> specification language and its associated tools. The conference will consist of talks that present developments concerning the TLA<sup>+</sup> language and tools, and of contributed talks.

Contributed talks should present work of interest to users of TLA<sup>+</sup> or PlusCal, such as:

* Industrial and academic case studies
* Use of the TLA<sup>+</sup> tools or reports on their shortcomings
* TLA<sup>+</sup> in trainings and education

The presentations should be informal and leave sufficient time for discussions. There will not be formal proceedings, and presentations of relevant work published elsewhere are welcome.

#### When?

Proposals for presentations, with a short (1-2 page) abstract summarizing the content, should be sent by July 01, 2019 to tla2019@tlapl.us. Notification will be given by July 15, 2019. The abstracts and presentations given at the event will be made available on the Web.

#### Location?

The conference will take place in St. Louis, MO, USA, on September 15, 2019. The conference will take place as part of Strange Loop 2019. Participants are required to register through the Strange Loop Web site.
