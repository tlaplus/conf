### What is TLA+?
<!-- Point at industrial success stories of TLA+ (Amazon/Microsoft/...) -->
TLA<sup>+</sup> is a formal language for specifying systems that is used in industry and academia to verify complex distributed and concurrent systems. Among others, the TLA<sup>+</sup> methodology is successfully applied at [Amazon Web Services](http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/amazon-excerpt.html) and [Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-cosmos-db-pushing-the-frontier-of-globally-distributed-databases/).

Tool support for TLA<sup>+</sup> is provided through the TLA<sup>+</sup> Toolbox, an Integrated Development Environment for writing TLA<sup>+</sup> specifications and analyzing them using the TLA<sup>+</sup> tools. The tools include the TLC model checker, the PlusCal algorithm language and its translator, and the TLA<sup>+</sup> Proof System.

### TLA+ Community Event?

We will [again](http://tla2018.loria.fr/) organize a meeting for presenting new developments around TLA+ and exchanging around ongoing work. The meeting is planned as a satellite of the [Symposium on Distributed Computing](http://www.disc-conference.org/wp/disc2020/) in mid-October. Due to the ongoing pandemic the meeting will in all likelihood take place as a virtual meeting online, with the exact date(s) to be determined.

Please let us know if you have suggestions or requests for the content or the organization of the meeting. A call for contributions will be published once the format of the meeting has been fixed.
