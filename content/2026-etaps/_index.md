# TLA+ Community Event 2026



### Co-located with [ETAPS 2026](https://etaps.org/2026/) in Torino, Italy, on April 12, 2026.


[TLA+](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html) is a language that
is used in academia and industry for formally specifying systems. It is
supported by [verification tools](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tools.html), 
including the TLC and Apalache model checkers and the TLAPS proof system.
PlusCal serves as a frontend for generating TLA+ specifications from an
algorithmic language with an imperative flavor.

The TLA+ Community Event serves as a forum where practitioners and
researchers interested in the use and further development of the
TLA+ specification language and its tools meet and discuss.

Proposals for contributed talks are sollicited that present work of
interest to users of TLA+ or PlusCal, such as:

* industrial or academic case studies,
* new tools for TLA+ or add-ons to existing tools,
* innovative use of existing tools or reports on their shortcomings,
* use of TLA+ in education.

There will not be formal proceedings, but the abstracts and presentations will be made available on the Web.

Proposed contributions should be submitted by January 31, 2026 to tla2026@inria.fr.
It is expected that the contribution will be presented on 1-2 pages. 
Longer submissions will be read at the discretion of the program committee.

Participants will be required to register to ETAPS 2026 (early registration deadline: March 10, 2026).
