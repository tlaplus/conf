# TLA+ Community Event 2024

### The TLA+ Community Event 2024 will be organized as a satellite of [FM 2024](https://www.fm24.polimi.it) in Milan (Italy), on September 10, 2024.

[TLA+](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html) is a language that
is used in academia and industry for formally specifying systems. It is
supported by [verification tools](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tools.html), including the TLC and Apalache model checkers and the TLAPS proof system.
PlusCal serves as a frontend for generating TLA+ specifications from an
algorithmic language with an imperative flavor.

The TLA+ Community Event serves as a forum where practitioners and
researchers interested in the use and further development of the
TLA+ specification language and its tools meet and discuss.

Proposals for contributed talks are sollicited that present work of
interest to users of TLA+ or PlusCal, such as:

* industrial or academic case studies,
* new tools for TLA+ or add-ons to existing tools,
* innovative use of existing tools or reports on their shortcomings,
* use of TLA+ in education.

Proposals for presentations, with a short (2 page) abstract summarizing
the content, should be sent to [tla2024@inria.fr](mailto:tla2024@inria.fr)
by June 15, 2024. Please indicate if you want to give a short or long
presentation (25 or 40 minutes, including discussion). Notification will
be given by June 29, 2024. 

There will not be formal proceedings, but the abstracts and presentations
will be made available on the Web.

Participants will be required to register to FM 2024.
