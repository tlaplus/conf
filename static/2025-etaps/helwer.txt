I am allegedly part of organizing this conference so we can just throw this one in if there's a dearth of material. It would be a 25 minute talk.

Title: It's never been easier to write TLA⁺ tooling!

Summary:

Let a thousand flowers bloom! While TLA⁺ development resources have focused on polishing the Java-based tools in recent years, we have also seen the development of novel applications like Spectacle, a web-based TLA⁺ interpreter written by William Schultz. Does this herald a new era for TLA⁺ language tooling?

In this talk you'll learn about recent efforts to make it easy to write a minimal TLA⁺ parser, interpreter, and even model-checker. Many other languages enjoy great numbers of these toy implementations. Far from proving a distraction, these projects are actually critical to preparing community members to tackle the really difficult problems found in industrial-strength language tooling. Once you've implemented a TLA⁺ parser, all other TLA⁺ parsers become familiar to you!

What difficult problems could these toy implementations prepare us for? The talk concludes with a call to action: the 1 billion states per minute initiative, which proposes writing a TLA⁺ bytecode interpreter to improve TLC throughput by 1,000 times or more. How can it be done? A tentative roadmap is proposed.
