      <description>Semantic highlighting in TLA+ Andrew Helwer Syntax highlighting uses text color and formatting to communicate useful information to users of a formal language; this is generally accomplished with regular expressions identifying keywords, literals, and common functions. There has been a recent trend toward using more powerful grammars that fully parse languages and expose complex semantic information in highlighting. This talk details the recent development of such a grammar for TLA+ using tree-sitter, an error-tolerant incremental parser generator.</description>

      <description>What can you do with a few days? Mike Lusignan Crowdstrike TLA+ is an indispensable tool for maintaining correctness in highly complex, concurrent environments. Why isn&amp;rsquo;t it used more in industry? One of the objections levied in general at formal methods is that they require a substantial investment in time, in opposition to other software development activities. Our experience at CrowdStrike is that this simply is not true.
In this talk, I&amp;rsquo;ll review past and ongoing experiences with TLA+ at CrowdStrike.</description>
